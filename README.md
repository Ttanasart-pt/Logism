Logisim is a circuit simulator, [originally available here](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).
This is a fork from [original repotiory](https://github.com/lawrancej/logisim) This is a personal project
aimed at improving **my** experience using this software.

* Upgrade gradle from 2.2 to 6.8.1
* Remove Sonar plugin from build.gradle
* Remove deprecated lookandfeel
* Add keyboard shortcuts.
